## 3RStore
An application for storing links online.

# Status
This is very much in the early development stages, use is not only impossible but also discouraged :)
As soon as proper functionality and security measures are in place the plan is to make the app available to the public.

# Running it locally
Ooh boy here we go.

First of all you need [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
and Flask: 

    pip install Flask

If you don't have Pip, instructions for its installation are available [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Now, navigate to /3RStore/3RStore and use: 

    python 3RStore.py
to launch the server. A prompt indicating sucessfull launch should appear in the console.

Finally, open your browser and go to 

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Ta-da!
